# Face Recognition App with Flask and Deep Learning ***(Project still running : Stay tuned)***
This repository packs a powerful punch: a face detection and recognition application built with cutting-edge Python tools.

***What's inside?***

**Flask API**: A lightweight and versatile framework for building the application's backend.
**MTCNN**: A lightning-fast face detection model to pinpoint those mugshots with precision.
**Keras-Facenet**: Leverages deep learning to generate unique facial embeddings, unlocking the power of recognition.
**OpenCV**: The king of real-time computer vision, enabling image processing and manipulation.
**TensorFlow**: The muscle behind it all, providing the deep learning foundation.


***Why choose this?***

Modern Stack: Utilizes the latest and greatest libraries for superior performance and maintainability.
Modular Design: Code is well-structured for easy understanding and customization.
Ready to Run: Get started quickly with clear instructions and pre-trained models (where applicable).


***Who's it for?***

Developers curious about building face recognition applications.
Hobbyists looking for a deep dive into computer vision and deep learning.
Anyone interested in exploring the power of facial recognition technology.
Getting Started


***Clone the repository:***

Bash
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-recognition-app.git

```
Use code with caution.

***Install dependencies:***

Bash
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Use code with caution.

***(Optional) Download pre-trained models:***

Some models may require separate download. Refer to the models folder for instructions.

Run the app:

Bash
```
python app.py
```
Use code with caution.

This will start the Flask server. APIs for face detection and recognition will be available.

Detailed instructions for customization and usage are provided within the codebase.

Inspiration
This project serves as a foundation for building more sophisticated applications. Consider exploring:

Facial landmark detection: Pinpoint specific features like eyes and mouth for advanced recognition.
Real-time video processing: Apply face detection and recognition directly to a video stream.
Integration with databases: Link faces to names for user identification.
Let's unlock the potential of face recognition together!
